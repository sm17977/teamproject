# Team Effort Log
*In this section, add a heading for each team member, and under it add the sub headings "Sprint 1, Sprint 2, ..., Sprint N", as illustrated below.  Each team member can be responsible for writing their own section.*

## Team member name 1

*Edit the name above to match the name of the team member.  That team member is then responsible for this section.*

### Sprint 1 (University Week 3):
* *Include a URL to the most siginificant Jira tasks assigned to you in sprint 1, and state when (or whether) it was completed, and the hours spent.*
* *Example: "Link to Task 2.  It was set and completed in sprint 2.  It took 1 hour.  Extra relevant comment."*
* *To save time, just describe the main (e.g. no more than 3) Jira issues assigned to you in this sprint. You are free to pick which 3 to describe.*
* *Describe any relevant java coding completed by you in Sprint 1.  Optionally include permalinks to your gitlab commits.*
* *Include the university week number in the subheading, as above.*

### Sprint 2 (University Week 4):

*Do the same for each fully completed sprint.*


## Team member name 2

*Repeat for each team member, i.e. with more subheadings "Sprint1, Sprint2, ... Sprint N"*


## Team member Finlay Georgiou-Young

### Sprint 1 (University Week 3)



### Sprint 2 (University Week 4)

* [Task 1](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE291T21-8). It was set in sprint 2 and completed in sprint 3. It took 1 hour. I had to link IntelliJ with GitLab and push a simple hello world program to GitLab.
* [Task 2](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE291T21-20). It was set in sprint 2 and completed in sprint 3. It took 1 hour. I had to upload a true photo to GitLab and Jira. 


### Sprint 3 (University Week 5)

* [Task 1](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE291T21-8). It was set in sprint 2 and completed in sprint 3. It took 1 hour. I had to link IntelliJ with GitLab and push a simple hello world program to GitLab.
* [Task 2](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE291T21-20). It was set in sprint 2 and completed in sprint 3. It took 1 hour. I had to upload a true photo to GitLab and Jira. 


### Sprint 3 (University Week 6)

* [Task 1](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE291T21-55). It was set in sprint 3 and completed in sprint 5. It took 1 hour. I had to list the Functional requirements of the project in the comments of my sub-task. These could then be implemeted into the markdown documentation. 
* [Task 2](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE291T21-60). It was set in sprint 3 and completed in sprint 5. It took 3 hours. I had to list the Non-Functional requirements of the project. These could then be implemeted into the markdown documentation.
* [Task 3](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE291T21-49). It was set in sprint 3 and completed in sprint 5. It took 1 hour. I had to list User-Stories in the comments of my sub-task. These could then be created into User-Stories on Jira.
* In this week I coded the GUI(the layout) for the application and pushed it to our GitLab repositiry. I created a JFrame with the buttons and text fields necessary for our application. The components in the frame were split up into JPanels, the users name would be at the top, the data would be shown in the center and the buttons and text fields would be on the bottom. This took 3 hours.

### Sprint 4 (University Week 7)

* [Task 1](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE291T21-55). It was set in sprint 3 and completed in sprint 5. It took 1 hour. I had to list the Functional requirements of the project in the comments of my sub-task. These could then be implemeted into the markdown documentation. 
* [Task 2](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE291T21-60). It was set in sprint 3 and completed in sprint 5. It took 3 hours. I had to list the Non-Functional requirements of the project. These could then be implemeted into the markdown documentation.
* [Task 3](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE291T21-49). It was set in sprint 3 and completed in sprint 5. It took 1 hour. I had to list User-Stories in the comments of my sub-task. These could then be created into User-Stories on Jira.


### Sprint 5 (University Week 8)

* [Task 1](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/CE291T21-68). It was set in sprint 5 and completed in sprint 5. It took x hours. I had to collaborate with my team in completing each markdown doumentation file.
* In this week I made updates to the GUI and added some listeners to the buttons. I Gave the application a tab design using a JTabbedPane. In the first tab the user will input their bank balance, the company symbol and shares they have in that company, so I implemented the necessary buttons and text fields to allow the user to do so. I also coded the buttons so if the user enters above 5 companies, an appropriate message is shown. I made it so the input bank balance is saved in an integer instance variable, and the company and amount of shares is saved in a HashMap instance variable, with the company symbol as the key and the share amount as the value. With these values stored as instance variables, it allows the information to be taken and used in the other tab, which will show necessary data.
