# Requirements and Risk Log

*In this markdown document, list all of the requirements that you have identified for your product so far.*

# Requirements

*List several user stories (no more than 8) that describe the product requriements. For each user story that you include:*

* *Include a URL link to the Jira user-story issue.*
* *Paste in the Story Description and Story Summary for Jira.  Attempt to keep story summaries in the form taught in the lectures, i.e. the form "As a [persona], I [want to], [so that]".  Feel free to update your Jira issues into this form if they are not already.*
* *Give details of whether this story has been assigned to someone yet, and whether it is completed yet.*
* *Include a screenshots of any relevant attachments.*

*In addition to user stories (which is the main thing we are trying to teach for agile), try to include one or two other requirement modelling techniques, e.g. as listed in the lecture.*

*Try to group the requirements under two sub-headings: functional requirements, and non-functional requirements.*

*When marking this section we will be looking to see your team has understood the correct way to represent User-Stories and one or more other requirement modelling methods, and the requirements listed are give as much relevant information for the development team as possible.*

### Functional:

* The application should be able to show the total value of the users investments (bank balance + shares).
* The application should allow the user to input a date within the last 3 years and view the value of their total investments at that time.
* The application should be able to take information about company shares from CSV files to be used to display the users total investment value.
* The application ahould be able to create a table based on the total value of the users investments at a given time.
* The application should allow the user to input their their bank balance, the companies they have shares with and the amount of shares they have with each company.
* The application should allow the user to enter in up to 5 companies and no more.
* The application should include validation and exception handling for all user input fields to prevent incorrect data formats used.


### Non-Functional:

* The applications code should be commented, so it is easy to maintain and fix bugs.
* The application should be user friendly (easy to learn and understand).
* The application should have a fast response time (below 1 second).
* The application should follow a clear structure to allow other developers to easily understand what the code does.
* 


## Risk Log

*In this section list the risks you have identified for your project.  For each Risk identified:*

* *Include a URL link to the Jira risk issue.* 
* *Paste in the Risk's Description and Summary from Jira.  Also state the Impact and Likilihood.*
* *Give details of whether this story has been assigned to someone yet, and whether it is completed yet.*
* *Include, from the Jira description / comments, details of what mitigating actions are being taking and by whom.*

*When marking this section we will be looking to see several realistic risks have been noted, and are actively being tracked and mitigated against.*
