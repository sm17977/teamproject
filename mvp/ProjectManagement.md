# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

*Include a paragraph or two, agreed by all team members, on how well the group has worked together, and how well the project is progressing.*
We worked well together
As a team, we feel that we work well as a group. The project progressed to a satisfactory level and despite some setbacks, we were able to complete the MVP and get everyone up to speed. We feel that there was a lack of intiative in completed our assigned tasks during the first few sprints which has since been resolved. During Weeks 6 and 7, our team members found themselves overwhelmed with the heavy workload from our other modules. This unfortunately resulted in the project experiencing a period where the contributed work was minimal. Due to the buildup of tasks towards the end of the project, it became difficult to evenly distribution specific tasks. This resulted in us taking the initiative to organise meetings outside of the lab hours to collaborate on the required tasks for the project and to help us get an understanding of each other's code.
