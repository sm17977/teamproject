# MVP Demonstration

*This section should contain a brief description and demo of product you have built.*

* *Include screenshots (actual screenshots, not mock ups) of all of the facets of the product working.*
* *Link consecutive screenshots together with a brief narrative explaining how the product works, e.g. a sentence "Click on OK and it takes you to the next window", "On starting the app, the following window is shown".  This document should not take you a long time to create - it's just pasting photos and adding explanatory sentences between them, so that your MVP is adequately described.*
* *Make sure an image of each window of your software is included - so that a person who has not seen the actual demo of the product has a good idea of what your product currently does.*
* *If your product is a physical device (a hardware product) then you may replace all of the above screenshots by actual photos/vidoes where you feel it is appropriate.*
* *Make sure this section includes any functionality/features you are particularly proud of.*
* *Indicate clearly which parts of the functionality shown in the screeshots are currently incomplete, and what is likely to change in the final version.  For example if a graph displayed is currently based on static hard-coded data for the MVP, but in the future version the graph will dynamically change depending on fresh data, then point this out explicitly.*


Our product has 2 tabbed panes, one for collecting necessary data from the user and one for displaying information to the user.
The first tab that will be shown is the input tab

The input tab has a text field where the user inputs their bank balance and a button which will set the users balance to an instance variable.
When the button is pressed a message will be shown in the center panel telling the user if their input balance has been set.

The input tab also has two text fields where the user inputs a company they have shares in and the amount of shares they have in that company.
There is a button which when pressed adds the company input and the share amount input into a map instance variable. 
The map takes the company symbol as the key and the share amount as the value.
